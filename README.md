- For more details on this project please visit the [FurutaPendulum-Simulation](https://github.com/feippolito/FurutaPendulum-Simulation/) github repository.

This repository contains the LabVIEW code utilized in the parameters identification and control of the Furuta Pendulum.
- The control of the pendulum in its upright position is done by state-space control feedback.-
- The wing up is done by analysing the pendulums knitic and potencial energy.
