# Furuta Pendulum Control

This repository contains the LabVIEW code utilized in the parameters identification and control of the Furuta Pendulum.
- The control of the pendulum in its upright position is done by state-space feedback control.
- The swing-up is done by analysing the pendulum's kinetic and potential energy.
