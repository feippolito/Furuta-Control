# Furuta Pendulum Control

- For more details on this project please visit the [FurutaPendulum-Simulation](https://github.com/feippolito/FurutaPendulum-Simulation/) github repository.

This repository contains the LabVIEW code utilized in the parameters identification and control of the Furuta Pendulum.
- The control of the pendulum in its upright position is done by state-space feedback control.
- The swing-up is done by analysing the pendulum's kinetic and potential energy.
